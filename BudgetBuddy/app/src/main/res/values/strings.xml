    <string name="Tutorial_Welcome">Welcome to BudgetBuddy! This app will help plan out your budget and help you to save money.
        We want for our users to be budget conscious and to develop proper spending habits.</string>
    <string name="Tutorial_Welcome2">This tutorial will teach you the basics of the app and how to track and view expenses.  Letâ€™s start!</string>
    <string name="Entering_Income">First, how much income do you have each month? (Estimate if you need but for best results try to calculate monthly income)</string>
    <string name="Save_Per_Month">And how much would you like to save each month (Either percentage or dollar amount)?</string>
    
    
        <string name="Intro_Screenshot">The page below is one of the first pages you will see when using BudgetBuddy.
        On this page you can enter your expenses for a set time.  For this example, we will record our monthly expenses. </string>
    <string name="Set_budget">After entering your monthly expenses, we now need to set a budget!
        Based of your expenses that you have inputted try coming up with a budget based off your income.  When creating a budget try to account for both regular and irregular expenses that occur to give a little bit of buffer room in case.
        Below is an example.</string>
    <string name="cost_saving">Now that you have inputted expenses and made a budget the next step is to start saving money.
        Go back and view your expenses and compare that to your set budget.
        Look at your expenses and determine which are essential and non-essential.
        If you see many non-essential costs, it may be time to cut back in certain areas to save!</string>
    <string name="goal_and_tips">Finally choose something to save for! Set a goal for what you want to save towards.  This can be either short term or long-term goals.  Make sure to write down your goal so that you can remind yourself of what you are saving for.
        We wish you the best in your budgeting journey.  If you have further questions, please visit the Tips page where you can see more information about budgeting.
